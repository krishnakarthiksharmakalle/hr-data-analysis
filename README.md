 Introduction
In this project, we analyze employee presence data from AtliQ Technologies. The HR team conveyed specific requirements, which we addressed through comprehensive data analysis and visualization in Power BI. This project demonstrates practical data analytics skills and is built on a real dataset.

 Project Objectives
- Understand and preprocess the employee presence data.
- Perform detailed data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the insights.
- Provide actionable recommendations to the HR department based on the analysis.

 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about employee presence at AtliQ Technologies. Key features include:
- Employee ID
- Date
- Check-in Time
- Check-out Time
- Department
- Role
- Attendance Status

 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Detailed steps taken to clean and preprocess the data:
1. Handling Missing Values: Identified and managed missing values.
2. Data Transformation: Converted date and time fields to appropriate formats.
3. Outlier Detection: Detected and handled outliers in the data.
4. Data Enrichment: Additional calculated fields for analysis were added.

 Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:
- Descriptive Statistics: Summary of key statistics for employee attendance.
- Trend Analysis: Monthly and daily employee check-ins and check-outs trends.
- Department-wise Analysis: Comparison of attendance across different departments.
- Role-based Analysis: Insights into attendance patterns based on employee roles.

Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the insights from the analysis. Key features of the dashboard include:
- Overview Tab: High-level summary of employee attendance.
- Department Insights Tab: Detailed analysis for each department.
- Role Insights Tab: Analysis based on employee roles.
- Trends Tab: Monthly and daily attendance trends.

## Key Insights
- **Overall Attendance Rate**: X% average attendance rate.
- **Peak Attendance Days**: Identified days with highest attendance.
- **Departments with Highest Absenteeism**: Departments that need attention.
- **Role-specific Patterns**: Key insights into attendance based on roles.

## Conclusions
- The analysis provided valuable insights into employee attendance patterns.
- The Power BI dashboard enables HR to proactively monitor attendance and identify issues.
- Recommendations were made to improve attendance rates and address specific departmental issues.

## Future Work
- **Enhance Dashboard**: Add more interactive features and drill-down capabilities.
- **Predictive Analysis**: Implement predictive models to forecast attendance trends.
- **Employee Feedback Integration**: Incorporate employee feedback to correlate with attendance data.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atliq-employee-presence-analysis.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Power BI installed.
3. **Load Data**: Load the dataset into Power BI.
4. **Run Analysis**: Follow the steps in the notebook for data cleaning and analysis.
5. **View Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard.
