 Introduction
In this project, we analyze employee presence data from AtliQ Technologies. The HR team conveyed specific requirements, which we addressed through comprehensive data analysis and visualization in Power BI. This project demonstrates practical data analytics skills and is built on a real dataset.

 Project Objectives
- Understand and preprocess the employee presence data.
- Perform detailed data analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the insights.
- Provide actionable recommendations to the HR department based on the analysis.

 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about employee presence at AtliQ Technologies. Key features include:
- Employee ID
- Date
- Check-in Time
- Check-out Time
- Department
- Role
- Attendance Status

 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Detailed steps taken to clean and preprocess the data:
1. Handling Missing Values: Identified and managed missing values.
2. Data Transformation: Converted date and time fields to appropriate formats.
3. Outlier Detection: Detected and handled outliers in the data.
4. Data Enrichment: Additional calculated fields for analysis were added.

 Data Analysis
The following analyses were performed:
- Descriptive Statistics: Summary of key statistics for employee attendance.
- Trend Analysis: Monthly and daily employee check-ins and check-outs trends.
- Department-wise Analysis: Comparison of attendance across different departments.
- Role-based Analysis: Insights into attendance patterns based on employee roles.

Power BI Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the insights from the analysis. Key features of the dashboard include:
- Overview Tab: High-level summary of employee attendance.
- Department Insights Tab: Detailed analysis for each department.
- Role Insights Tab: Analysis based on employee roles.
- Trends Tab: Monthly and daily attendance trends.
